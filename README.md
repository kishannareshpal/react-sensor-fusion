### React Sensor Fusion (DeviceMotionEvent)

Just a prototype of the web version of something like https://github.com/the-curve-consulting/expo-sensor-fusion

#### Demo

#### Getting started

1. `bun install`
2. `bun dev`
3. To access the device motion data on iOS you need to host this in HTTPS. You can do it easily using `ngrok https 5173` (or whatever port the web server started on)
